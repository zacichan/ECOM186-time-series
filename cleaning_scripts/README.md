**Information on Cleaning Scripts**

-   For LAs with Welsh names attached (i.e "E/W"), this has been grouped with the LAs using the English name which has been kept in the dataframe created (i.e. "E").

-   LAs with incomplete data for the years 2005-2023 have been removed. 98 LAs have been excluded. This may be due to factors such as LAs being absorbed by other LAs over the years.

-   Where LAs have been renamed, with data clearly matching up (e.g. AB has data 2005-2010 and AC has data 2010-2023), these have been manually combined. There were only two instances of this - *see rows 37-39*.
